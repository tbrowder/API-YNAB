=head1 DESCRIPTION

API::YNAB is a module providing access to the YNAB API and all the user's account data.
In order to access the user's account, he must generate a personal token with YNAB's executable and provide its value as the value of
an environment variable C<YNAB_TOKEN> at every https request.

This module will include a program to obtain various YNAB information in JSON format. Another program
will convert the JSON data into OFX format suitable for uploading into the free L<https://gnucash.org|GnuCash> double-entry accounting program.
Of course the OFX should be able to be used in other programs as well. Note the OFX format is documented at L<https://financialdataexchange.org>.
